This module exposes all the functions and classes from the [obsidian API](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api).

This is mostly useful when writing scripts. 

Refer to the obsidian API [declaration file](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api/blob/master/obsidian.d.ts) for more informations.
